    <p>
        When I took my son to see the 
        <a href="https://vangoghexpo.com/">Van Gogh Immersive Experience</a> in Denver, 
        I quickly came to learn that this was a complicated man, struggling to contain the 
        war he fought within himself every day. Vincent van Gogh lived during a time when 
        mental health was completely misunderstood and poorly treated. Using art as an outlet 
        and coping mechanism, he implemented his masterful understanding of color theory to 
        calm the storm within his mind. 

        For example, it is believed that the reds and greens used within his painting, 
        "The Night Café," were used to convey the tumultuous emotions he felt in that 
        particular setting. "Vincent's Bedroom in Arles" is composed with warm and 
        comforting colors, possibly to reflect van Gogh's need for a place of refuge 
        and peace amidst his turbulent life. Unfortunately, the most heartbreaking 
        part about van Gogh's story is that eventually art would not be able to save 
        him from his disquieting thoughts. In despair of ever being able to overcome 
        his loneliness or be cured, he brought his artistic career and life to an end 
        in May of 1890, shooting himself and dying two days later.

    <p>
        Vincent van Gogh's story as an artist touched me in a way that I could not have expected. 
        Like van Gogh, I use art to not only express myself but also to calm my mind and nerves. 
        It quiets my most persistent ruminations, allowing me time to simply exist. 
        But unlike van Gogh, I am extremely thankful that I have access to far more mental health resources. 
        I wish van Gogh could have had that luxury as well.
