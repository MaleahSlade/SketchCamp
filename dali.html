        <p>Salvador Dalí Portrait</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Early last year, I decided to buy tickets for the 
        <a href="https://thedali.org/exhibit/dali-alive-360/">Dalí Alive 360°</a> immersive exhibit. 
        I had no prior knowledge of Dalí's works, besides his iconic melting clock painting, 
        <i>Persistence of Memory</i>. I quickly learned that Dalí was so much more than just a surrealist artist.

    <p>
        Dalí was not limited to one distinct style. A true student, he explored a variety of mediums 
        and approaches, conquering complicated techniques while exploring and developing unique perspectives. 
        His known collection of works is expansive, with more than 1,000 of his works available to the public. 
        While some of his pieces reflected the Spanish landscape of his youth, others were inspired by Dalí's dreams, 
        political and religious views. His masterful body of work gives clear evidence that he was one of the last great 
        artists of the 20th century.
